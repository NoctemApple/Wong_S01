Hi, My name is Joshua Ryan G. Wong.
I studied in DLSU-D for way too long, this year as a fourth year student this is my 10th year in the campus as I was here from grade 7 to today. As of yesterday when this was written, I have finished my internship in TaskUs Molino as the last remaining intern there.
