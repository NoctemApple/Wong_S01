Hi, My name is Joshua Ryan G. Wong.
I studied in DLSU-D for way too long, this year as a fourth year student this is my 10th year in the campus as I was here from grade 7 to today. As of yesterday when this was written, I have finished my internship in TaskUs Molino as the last remaining intern there.
 I love video games way more then any other media. 
Currently obsessed with Baldurs Gate 3 along with my gachas. 
Might occasionally play Valorant if peer pressured but for now BG3 is life 
Favourite band is Kessoku Band. 
As for my favourite movie I think its got to be the Dungeons and Dragons Honor Among thieves which was released earlier this year
